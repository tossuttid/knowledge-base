*The following is my dirty summary of the precious work of Nic Barker* [link](https://youtu.be/U-ve8Yh4Ro8)

Modern education system has a complicated relationship with mathematics. It remains one of the most feared subjects in school, and that extends all the way throught your adulthood.

We don't have a definitive answer for why maths seems to standout in producing that poor learning experience and outcomes.

## Common theories of other people

- The students are the problem
    - Short attention span
    - Don't do homework
- The teachers are the problem
    - Don't understand deeply enough to teach properly
- The curriculum is the problem
    - Too abstract, not practical
    - Tryhard or slow
- Stardardised testing is the problem
    - Short memorization, not foundational
    - Punitive

## Nic's theory:

Math is just hard to learn ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

Math is well known for it's hability to expres complex and powerfull ideas with an incredible simple and elegant notation.

That notation was created and designed by people to serve a porpouse.

### Math notation

- Correct
    - Logically
- Unambiguous
    - Single posible intepretation
- Compact (the problem)

Math notation is just hard to learn ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

$$ 1 - - 2 = 3 $$

Memorization is extremely visual

## 5 steps to "I don't get math"

1. Oversimplified concepts force students to memorize "exceptions"
2. Subtle changes to notation over time
3. Small accumulated mistakes in exams
4. Declining exam results, loss of confidence
5. Abandonment

Expression = Expression

Expression / Expression

$$ 6/2 $$

It behaves like equals but can only:

- Multiply both expressions (sides)
- Divide both expressions (sides)

If you do another thing, you're modifying the ratio balance

Hasta acá llegué con el resumen, falta terminarlo y resumir, muy buena la conclusión del video
